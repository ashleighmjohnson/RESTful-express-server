# What:
# How:
# Integration: This page is accesed through the app.get function located at lines 143 to 165 of app.js, where when the directory "/products/(id)" is navigated to, this page is rendered.
# The View button located at line 29 of show.ejs navigates the user to the directory ./products/(id), where (id) is the id of the product they selected. This prompts app.js to get the 
# corresponding product from products.json, an object which is subsequently passed to show.ejs to display the name, price, category, and description of.
# Why: 

<section class="product-details">
    <h2>
        <%= product.name %>
    </h2>

    <div class="product-info">
        <p class="price">Price: $<%= product.price.toFixed(2) %>
        </p>
        <p class="category">Category: <%= product.category %>
        </p>
        <p class="description">
            <%= product.description %>
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="actions">
        <a href="/products" class="btn">Back to Products</a>
        <a href="/products/<%= product.id %>/edit" class="btn edit-btn">Edit</a>
        <button class="btn delete-btn" data-id="<%= product.id %>">Delete</button>
    </div>
</section>
